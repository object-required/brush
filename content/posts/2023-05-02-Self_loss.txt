Apparently, we're experiencing self-loss. While it sounds
rather unsettling, it actually means we have to find what
brings us closer to ourselves, and pursue it.

The struggle is that we need to take things slowly, for
psychological matters rarely change overnight - but it's
so tempting to reach some destination (despite we know it's
a continuous process).

We're lucky to be in a place when we don't have to worry
about physical safety or basic needs. Some time should be
at our disposal as well. So, although it's difficult, we
can't complain.
