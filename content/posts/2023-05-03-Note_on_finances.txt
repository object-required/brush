Well, turns out the financial side of things is going to be more
challenging than we initially thought. Should we decide to move
out and still support our partner, we'll be living paycheck to
paycheck, which is something we haven't done in years. That is,
after we cut back on unnecessary expenses and carefully choosing
the food we are having.

We're stressed out because it means building an emergency fund
will be difficult. And we will heavily depend on our ability to
work and earn money.

On the bright side, it's still not a growing debt situation.
And we got each other's fluffy backs.
