Hiya,

A quick update. We've started taking Escitalopram. Lucky to have
it around; thank goodness they can sell antidepressants without
prescription in Thailand, if you're asking confidently enough.

We had not been feeling like ourselves until the first day of
taking the medicine, and it's way better now. Though, while we
are going to have a full week course recommended for anxiety
and depression, we're also seeking professional support, both
psychological and psychiatric.

Honestly, it's all a little bit scary -- but also fascinating.
We have never taken anything changing the way our brain works
before, and it's just... wow.

Over and out,
~Ena
