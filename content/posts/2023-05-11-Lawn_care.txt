LAWN CARE SUMMARY

WATER weekly before 10 AM or between 4-6 PM. The amount should
be 2.5 cm - use a cup to measure. If you can insert a 15 cm
screwdriver easily, the soil is watered well. NEW grass should
have top 5 cm moist, mist daily until it becomes 8 cm tall.

MOWING can be done when it's above 4 C consistently. You should
trim 8-9 cm tall grass down to 5 cm. Make sure it's dry before
you start.

We never took care of lawns, but dreamt of having one since
early childhood. They sold "Canada Green" seeds in a TV Shop
back in 2000s, and we hoped to have a nice green yard to relax
on. Fast forward 20 years, we can finally enjoy one.
